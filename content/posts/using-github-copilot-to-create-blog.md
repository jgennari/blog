I recently installed the Github Copilot extension for VS Code. I've been using it for a few days now, and I'm really impressed. I've been using it to generate the basic structure of my blog posts. I'm going to use this post to show you how I'm using it, and how I'm going to use it in the future.

I mean, I guess I already showed you. The crazy part is that it's contextual with my whole blog. So it knows the other source files, projects I'm working on, tags and categories. Super useful.
